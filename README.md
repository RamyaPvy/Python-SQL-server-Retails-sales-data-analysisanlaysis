# Retail Sales Analysis ‚Äì End-to-End Data Pipeline (Python + SQL Server)

## üìå Project Overview 
This project demonstrates a **comprehensive data analysis pipeline** using **Python and SQL Server** to derive meaningful business insights from a **Retail Sales Dataset**. The pipeline includes **data extraction, cleaning, transformation, database integration, and SQL-based analysis.**  
By leveraging **Python for data processing and SQL for analytical queries**, this project provides valuable insights into **sales trends, revenue generation, and product performance.**  

## **üîó Workflow**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Extraction:** Retrieved dataset using Kaggle API.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Cleaning & Processing:** Processed the data using Python (Pandas).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Storage:** Loaded the cleaned data into SQL Server.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Data Analysis:** Executed SQL queries to generate business insights.

## **üìä SQL-Based Analytical Queries**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Top 10 Highest Revenue-Generating Products**
Identified the **top-performing products** based on revenue.  

```sql
SELECT TOP 10 product_name, SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Best-Selling Products in Each Region**  
Ranked products based on total sales volume in different regions.  

```sql
WITH RankedProducts AS (
    SELECT region, product_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_sold,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY SUM(quantity) DESC) AS rank
    FROM sales_data
    GROUP BY region, product_name
)
SELECT region, product_name, total_sold
FROM RankedProducts WHERE rank <= 5;
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Month-over-Month Sales Growth (2022 vs 2023)**  
Compared sales growth for the same months in different years.  

```sql
SELECT FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MM') AS sales_month,
       SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(order_date) = 2022 THEN revenue ELSE 0 END) AS revenue_2022,
       SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(order_date) = 2023 THEN revenue ELSE 0 END) AS revenue_2023,
       (SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(order_date) = 2023 THEN revenue ELSE 0 END) - 
        SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(order_date) = 2022 THEN revenue ELSE 0 END)) AS revenue_growth
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MM')
ORDER BY sales_month;
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Best Sales Month for Each Product Category**
Determined the **month with peak sales** for each category.

```sql
WITH MonthlySales AS (
    SELECT category, FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MM') AS sales_month,
           SUM(revenue) AS total_revenue,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY SUM(revenue) DESC) AS rank
    FROM sales_data
    GROUP BY category, FORMAT(order_date, 'yyyy-MM')
)
SELECT category, sales_month, total_revenue
FROM MonthlySales WHERE rank = 1;
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Sub-Category with Highest Profit Growth (2023 vs 2022)**
Analyzed which product **sub-category** had the highest profit growth.

```sql
WITH ProfitGrowth AS (
    SELECT sub_category,
           SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(order_date) = 2022 THEN profit ELSE 0 END) AS profit_2022,
           SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(order_date) = 2023 THEN profit ELSE 0 END) AS profit_2023,
           (SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(order_date) = 2023 THEN profit ELSE 0 END) - 
            SUM(CASE WHEN YEAR(order_date) = 2022 THEN profit ELSE 0 END)) AS profit_growth
    FROM sales_data
    GROUP BY sub_category
)
SELECT sub_category, profit_2022, profit_2023, profit_growth
FROM ProfitGrowth
ORDER BY profit_growth DESC;
```
